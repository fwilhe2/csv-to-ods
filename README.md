## Why

Many applications such as online banking only provide a csv export.
Opening csv files in spreadsheet applications is not a great experience.
With csv-to-ods, you can create proper spreadsheet files with type information and sensible formatting.

See `sample.csv` and `sample.csv.options.json`.
The options file is optional, but allows you to specify data types which gives you a much more usable spreadsheet file where numbers, dates and currencies are formatted properly.
